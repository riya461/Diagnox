Moderate Dementia
7
 The image shows signs of moderate dementia, which is a condition that affects memory, thinking, and reasoning. The ventricles, which are the fluid-filled spaces in the brain, are enlarged, and the brain tissue has shrunk. This is a common sign of dementia, as the ventricles enlarge and the brain tissue shrinks as the brain deteriorates. There is also a loss of white matter, which is the tissue that connects different parts of the brain. This can lead to problems with communication and coordination between different parts of the brain, which can result in memory loss and other cognitive problems.

The radiologist can cross-check these signs by looking for other evidence of dementia, such as memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with problem-solving. They can also order other tests, such as a blood test or a spinal tap, to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.
